## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Page ðŸ‘‹

Cool thing you were able to find it! I rely on GitHub mostly as a learning tool instead of a portfolio. If you're considering me for professional inquiries, please reach out in the social networks provided at the end of this README.

Here's a couple of cool things you can find:
- ðŸ¦„ Scholarship Submissions (WWDC)
- ðŸŽ’ Student / Learning Projects (iOS, Data Science)
- ðŸŽ¨ A really awesome Xcode theme
